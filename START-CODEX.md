Before we continue, carefully review the following documents
- **CONFIG.md** - Project-specific configuration values (testing site URL, SSH credentials, paths)
- **AGENTS.md**
- **SECURITY.md**
- **TESTING.md**
- The .prd document for the currently active project (If there is one)
- The most recent session report in the `docs\project-history\` directory to understand what was completed during the last session

## Confirm WP-CLI Available For The Testing Site
- Using the information in the TESTING.md file to confirm you can use WP-CLI to run tests on the testing website
- If successful, note that site testing is functional in your opening response to the user
- If unsuccessful, attempt to fix the problem yourself
- If your fix is successful, let the user know and suggest changes so that the problem does not recur in the future
- If your fix is unsuccessful, provide details of your analysis and next steps to solve the problem to the user.

## Additional Instructions
- Summarize the current project status
- List any pending tasks
