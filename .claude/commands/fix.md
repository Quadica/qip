# Address Issues Identified With A Code Review

## Core Instructions

1. A comprehensive code and security review has been completed, identifying one or more problems. The details are below.
2. Think harder and review these issues, and if you agree they need to be addressed, then implement an appropriate fix.
3. DO NOT assume that just because we have identified a problem, it really is an issue. Use your own judgment as to whether it needs to be fixed.

## Required Steps (MUST COMPLETE ALL)

**Step 1:** Analyze and fix the identified issues using think harder methodology

**Step 2:** Use the session-reporter agent to create a session report with complete details about changes made and rationale

**Step 3 (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP):** After the session-reporter agent finishes, you MUST add the following text block to the BEGINNING of the generated session report:

```
This report provides details of the code changes made to address the issues you identified and suggestions you made. Please perform a code review and security check of the fixes to ensure that the fix has solved the problem and that the changes made have not introduced any additional problems.
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Step 3 must be completed AFTER the session-reporter finishes. This is not optional.
