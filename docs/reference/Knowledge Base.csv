<h3>Did the Read Only Option In ACF Disappear?</h3>
If the Read Only option is not showing up in the ACF Field Groups, then check to be sure that the <b>Calculated fields for the ACF</b> plugin are installed and activated.

This plugin provides more options besides just additional field calculations.
<h3>504 Gateway Timeout Errors</h3>
Occasionally, you will see 504 Gateway errors in the admin. This error is usually caused by the server being overwhelmed by some process. E.g., incorrectly set filters.

Kinsta controls server resources using a PHP Worker allocation process. Our current account has been allocated 16 PHP workers. Adding more workers is very expensive, so you must figure out what function overwhelms the server.

For SPF, DMARC, and DKIM to work correctly when sending email from the luxeonstar.com domain with service@luxeonstar.com via our quadica.com Gmail account, you must include service@quadica.com as an alias in the <a href=""https://admin.google.com/"">Google Workspace Admin</a>. Go to Directory &gt; Users &gt; Quadica Office &gt; Add Alternate Emails and be sure that service@quadica.com is entered. If you don't have this address set up, emails sent from the luxeonstar.com domain will fail and end up in spam.

To figure this out I hired <a href=""https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/ronallison"">Ron Allison on Upwork</a>. Here is his explanation:
<blockquote><em>""OK, I added a specific alias, service@quadica.com, to the office@quadica.com email account. Because <a href=""http://luxeonstar.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">luxeonstar.com</a> is an alias domain to the primary domain <a href=""http://quadica.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">quadica.com</a>, the alias service@luxeonstar.com was created when service@quadica.com was created. I just tested an email to myself from service@luxeonstar.com and it passed SPF, DKIM and DMARC. I also just resent the email from the website to myself and it now passes SPF, DKIM and DMARC whereas before it passed only SPF, did not recognize and failed DMARC.""</em></blockquote>
<h3>Email Redirects</h3>
Note that these instructions are for full redirects. NOT forwarding. Redirects will redirect emails to a new email address without modifying the email message.

We currently have the following redirects set up. You will find them listed in the <a href=""https://admin.google.com/u/2/ac/apps/gmail/routing"">Email forwarding using the recipient address map</a> section.

<h3>Important Points About Setting Up Product Discount Rules</h3>
<h4>Always Enable The Discount Bar For Product Discounts</h4>
Our product templates are designed to only display discount prices for rules defined in the <a href=""https://handlaidtrack.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woo_discount_rules"">Woo Discount Rules plugin</a> if you enable the <strong>Discount Bar</strong> in the rule. The discount will not be shown if you don't enable the discount bar. <strong><em>However</em></strong>, the discount will still be applied when the product is added to the cart!
<h4>The Discount Bar Will Always Be Displayed For ALL Product Discount Rules!</h4>
Even though you may have the Discount Rules plugin set up to apply the discounts with the <strong>Biggest one from match rules</strong>, <em>the discount bar will still be displayed for ALL rules!</em>

To avoid confusion, you need to define filters so that only a single rule is shown for each product. (Unless you want to show multiple discount bars for some reason.) This also applies if you checkmark the <strong>Apply this rule if matched and ignore all other rules</strong> option. This will only apply the discount for that rule to the product, but any other rule that is defined for that product will have its discount bar displayed.
<h3>Displaying The Customer Name On The Product Page</h3>
You can display the name of the customer currently logged into the site on the product page, along with their specific discount price. E.g., <strong>Price for Ron Warris : $3.98.</strong> To do this, you need to enable the Discount Bar and then include <strong>display_customer_name</strong> in the Badge Text box where you want the customer's name displayed. This uses the <a href=""https://staging-luxeonstarleds.kinsta.cloud/wp-admin/admin.php?page=edit-snippet&amp;id=45"">Text Replacement for Discount Pricing</a> snippet to replace the display_customer_name text with the customer's name.

Normally you would always define specific <strong>User Role</strong> filters for any rule that you set up to display the customer name.",,publish,,product-discounts,"2022-11-06 22:43:53","2022-11-07 05:43:53",0,0,,0,18,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once the LED assembly has been picked and placed it is time for it to go through the reflow soldering process. There is no decisive order for what boards should be cooked first, it is decided on a batch to batch basis. Although, it is usually best to pick and place all the partials in the batch first so that they go through the oven all at once. Below you will find the necessary instructions needed to operate the reflow oven for soldering LED assemblies.

<hr />

<ol>
 	<li>Start the oven by <b>pulling up</b> the emergency stop button and turning the red dial to the <b>ON</b> position.</li>
 	<li>Turn on the internal fans using the red switch located on the right wall (when facing the oven)</li>
 	<li>Press <b>Enter</b> when prompted (a short tune will also play to indicate the oven is ready to use).</li>
 	<li>Use <b>F1</b> and <b>F2</b> to scroll through the options menu.</li>
 	<li>Select <b>PROFILES</b> using the <b>F3</b> button.</li>
 	<li>Use the <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> arrow keys to select a profile.
<ul>
 	<li><b>1-ALM-PAR</b> = Aluminium Star [RS20], Aluminium Tri [RT20], Aluminium Square [RS10] in 50/50, and all partials using the tray. (<b>except SR02</b>). <b>ALL</b> Sinkpads, including partials &amp; Z assemblies.</li>
 	<li><b>2-FR 1368</b> = Coolbase Star [SR01], Coolbase Tri [SR03], Coolbase Bubble Optic [SR06], and Coolbase Quad [SR08]</li>
 	<li><b>3-FR4 12</b> = Coolbase Star/O [SR12]</li>
 	<li><b>4-FR4 SQR</b> = Coolbase Square [SR05], Coolbase 4UP [110613], and Coolbase 9UP [08312-3A]</li>
 	<li><b>5-FR4 02</b> = Coolbase 7UP [SR02] using the tray</li>
 	<li><b>6-IGNORE</b></li>
 	<li><b>7-FR4 SR4</b> = Coolbase Side Emitter [SR04]</li>
 	<li><b>8-SZ 01!</b> = Full Frets of Z Assemblies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Once a profile is chosen use <b>F3</b> to return to the options menu.</li>
 	<li>Use <b>F1</b> or <b>F2</b> to scroll to the <b>WORK</b> option then select it using <b>F3</b>.</li>
 	<li>Select the <b>F1</b> button to start the oven.</li>
 	<li>In the lower left corner the oven will display two words: <b>RAMP</b> and <b>WORK</b>. The oven will flash <b>RAMP</b> as the oven heats to the proper temperature. When it is no longer flashing and displays <b>WORK</b> LED assemblies may be placed onto the conveyor belt.
<ul>
 	<li>When the oven is <b>first started</b> for the day and <b>after lunch</b> it will require an extra <b>20 minute</b> warm up after <b>WORK</b> has been displayed.</li>
 	<li><b>NEVER</b> place a full 100 RS10 fret into the reflow oven, they will not solder properly! Break the board horizontally from the fiducials into two pieces (50 strips per side)!</li>
 	<li>To prevent a pile up there must be a one board spacing between LED assemblies and when exiting they must be moved aside.</li>
 	<li>Never place an LED assembly and a tray in the oven at the same time, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>To stop the oven press <b>F3</b>. Press <b>F3</b> again to return to the options menu. This will also allow you to start from step four to choose a new profile.
<ul>
 	<li>This step should only be used at the end of the day or if the oven is going to remain idle <i>longer than</i> 20 minutes, such as at break. Once the external fans stop the oven will enter into sleep mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Once the external fans have stopped running the oven then can be shut down completely by turning the red dial to the <b>OFF</b> position and pressing in the emergency stop button.</li>
</ol>
When the LED assemblies have exited the oven and have cooled it is important to inspect them! Time and temperature are key to the reflow soldering process and if the profile is incorrect solder balls can form. This will result in undercooked LED assemblies that will not light and will have to be fixed by either running it through the oven again or using the hotplate. Another problem that can occur, even if the profile is correct, is that not all of the internal fans are running. If this is the case the oven (once clear of all LED assemblies) will have to be completely shut down for ten seconds then turned back on. The internal fans should all start working as soon as a profile is activated.

1. Generate a Thermal Pad PO <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">(LINK/REVISE)</span>.

2. Get the thermal pad cutting jig and some sheets of thermal material from beneath the laser.

3. On the laser control panel press 'X/Y Off'. Use the up &amp; down arrows to make clearance room for the jig to fit. <b>DO NOT</b> hit the reset button just yet.

4. Position the cutting jig in the upper left corner of the laser, then place a thermal sheet <b>SHINY SIDE DOWN (THIS IS IMPORTANT)</b>

5. Place magnets in each corner and the middle of each edge on the sheet.

6. Pull the blue bar and the laser carriage over the thermal sheet. Use the manual focus gauge and press the 'UP or DOWN' arrows to adjust the height of the table until the tip lightly touches the thermal sheet. Remove the gauge.

7. Double check to make sure the thermal sheet is <b>SHINY SIDE DOWN</b>. Now the 'X/Y positioning' can be reset by pressing the 'Reset' button on the laser control panel. The lens carriage will home itself in the top corner.

<i><b>Note: DO NOT save changes to Corel files during this process!</b></i>

1. Go to - Q:\Shared drives\Quadica\Luxeon\Thermal Tape\Thermal Stickers Library and open the Corel file corresponding to the next item on the PO. Once the correct file has been opened, delete everything except for the pale blue rectangle. This is used to ensure the laser will cut the sheet to the correct depth. It should not cut through the sheet during the test. The thermal sheet is only cut through when separating pads.

2. In Corel select 'Print' (or Ctrl + P) then go to 'Preferences' &gt; Advanced and select <b>Thermal Stickers, Thermal Stickers Tri, or Thermal Stickers Custom</b> depending on what you are cutting.

3. Click the third tab, 'Colour Mapping', and make sure 'Colour Mapping' is turned on in the upper right corner.

4. Go back into the Advanced tab and hit 'LOAD &gt; OK &gt; APPLY &gt; PRINT'

5. Turn on the blower for the laser. Press 'Go' on the laser control panel.

6. When the test is complete turn off the blower then open the laser table door. <b>DO NOT MOVE OR TOUCH THE JIG.</b>

7. Using a metal pick from the magnetic tool bar carefully remove the test strip from the thermal sheet. If the test strip has been cut through check to make sure the print profile is correct. If the test strip is non-removable check to make sure the manual focus gauge had been set properly. It is also possible that the lens need to be cleaned or that the print profile needs to be checked.

8. If there were no problems with the test strip undo the deletion of the Corel File using Ctrl + Z. Instead, remove the pale blue rectangle from the rest of the file and follow the same print procedure in steps 2 - 6.

9. When the thermal sheet has been cut remove the pieces from the laser and move onto the next sheet if cutting multiples. It is unnecessary to re-do the manual focus <b>unless</b> the laser has been left unattended or was used by someone else.

10. As the laser is cutting the new thermal sheet remove the edges from around the cut thermal pad strips.

11. Once all the thermal sheets have been cut they can be counted and compared to the printed paperwork. If correct follow these steps <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">(LINK) </span>for receiving in completed POs.

 	<li>Before using the paste, stir it lightly and thoroughly for one to four minutes while still in the original jar. Solder paste should be stirred in one direction with a clean mixing rod only used for stirring solder paste. Stirring the paste ensures an even distribution of any separated material (flux and metal) resulting from storage.</li>
 	<li>If the paste is watery, discolored, or otherwise does not look normal, discard it and use new paste.</li>
 	<li>For best results, the temperature and humidity of the areas where the paste is screened onto the board, components added, and reflow soldering is done should be maintained between 20° to 22°C at 45% ± 5% relative humidity.</li>
 	<li>If the temperature and humidity conditions are not maintained at optimal levels, the time the paste can be exposed to air is significantly reduced. For example, at 30°C and 30% - 70% RH, the time the paste can be exposed to the air is reduced to less than three hours. Solder paste is also more prone to defects such as slumping, solder balling, and viscosity changes when applied in excessive temperature/humidity environments.</li>

This is affixed to the front of the envelope or the side of the box. It contains an Order Number, Customer Name, Company Name, and Shipping Method. It it used to match <em><strong>ALL</strong> documents and items being shipped</em> to that package.

<h4><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Packing Slip</span></h4>
A document that tells us what is needed for an Order. It will include an Order Number, a Shipping Address with the Customer Name, the Shipping Method, and the SKU Part Number with quantity required to ship.

Most changes that need to be made to a discontinued product will happen automatically when you assign the product to the Discontinued Products category, including:
<ul>
 	<li>If there is no stock available, the product will be removed from all other categories.</li>
 	<li>If there is stock available, a process will monitor stock changes, and when the stock drops to &lt;1, it will remove all other categories at that time.</li>
 	<li>The Meta Name and Description for SEO will be updated to reflect that the product is no longer available. If a substitute product is entered into the Alternate box, then the description will suggest that alternate product.</li>
 	<li>The correct template will be assigned to the product based on the current stock status.</li>
 	<li>If there is no stock available, the Long Description will be changed to indicate that the product is no longer available. If a product is entered into the Alternate box, then a link to that product will be included. If there is still stock available, no changes will be made until the stock drops &lt; 1.</li>
</ul>
The following is not currently automated and will need to be manually changed:
<ul>
 	<li>Stock levels will need to be adjusted to
<ul>
 	<li>Preferred Stock Level &gt; -1</li>
 	<li>Order Increment &gt; 1</li>
 	<li>Low Stock Alert &gt; 0</li>

 	<li>Uncheck the product's Active State checkbox.</li>

<h4>PO Contains Color Mixer LED Modules</h4>
<h4>PO is From a Prepaid Order Customer</h4>
<h4>Customer Is Requesting Terms</h4>
Check to determine if we have ever shipped any orders to that organization using terms.
<ol>
 	<li>Go to the <a href=""https://luxeonstar.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=shop_order&amp;all_posts=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Orders</a> screen.</li>
 	<li>Add a Filter and search for just the domain part of the email address. E.g., If the email for the PO is rob@taymer.com, then search for all orders that contains <strong>taymer.com</strong>.</li>
 	<li>If one or more orders have <strong>Net Terms</strong> as the payment method, then the organization has a term account already set up with us, so you can just enter the PO as a term account order.</li>
 	<li>If none of the orders have Net Terms, then we will need to determine if they qualify for a term account. At present, ask Ron to make that determination.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Changing An Existing Customer Account From Prepaid to Terms</h4>
If an organization already has a term account with us, or if we have decided to extend terms, then you need to change all of the customers from the organization to use terms using the following procedure.
<ol>
 	<li>Go to the <a href=""https://luxeonstar.com/wp-admin/users.php"">Users</a> screen.</li>
 	<li>Add a Filter and search for just the domain part of the email address. E.g., If the email for the PO is rob@taymer.com, then search for all orders that contain <strong>taymer.com</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Turn on Inline Edit (The switch next to the Conditional Formatting button)</li>
 	<li>If there are multiple people from the same organization, then select all of the users by clicking the checkbox next to Name. This will enable bulk editing.</li>
 	<li>Click Bulk Edit in the Terms column and select the term. (Usually 30)</li>
 	<li>Click Bulk Edit in the Invoicing Email Address column and enter the email address the customer wants invoices sent to.</li>
 	<li>Click Bulk  Eidt in the Roles column, Select the <strong>ADD</strong> option, and then select <strong>Terms</strong>.</li>
 	<li>If there is only a single customer to edit, then you can edit these fields directly by clicking on the pencil</li>
</ol>
<h4>Creating A New Customer</h4>
If the person who sent the PO does not have an account in our system, then you will need to create one. This is done while you are creating the order for the PO.
<ol>
 	<li>Confirm that the customer does not have an account with us. Note that sometimes, the customer search function on the order entry page cannot find the customer. If that happens, open the <a href=""https://luxeonstar.com/wp-admin/users.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Users</a> section in a new browser tab and search for the customer's email address. If an account does not exist, then you can go back to the order and continue with creating the customer in the order.</li>
 	<li>In the order, click <strong>New Customer</strong>.</li>
 	<li>If the PO does not provide a name or department to use for the Billing name, then enter <strong>Accounts Payable</strong> as the first and last name.</li>
 	<li>Usually, you would enter the email address of the person who sent the PO unless the email message or PO specifically provides the email address for a different person or department.</li>
 	<li>Leave the <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> boxes blank.</li>
 	<li>Enter the Invoicing (billing) address from the PO.</li>
 	<li>If possible, always include a phone number, but if none is provided, leave the box blank.</li>
 	<li>Enter the company's Tax information in the <strong>Tax ID</strong> box if any is provided.</li>
 	<li>If the PO or email message provides details to ship using the company's own carrier account, then enter those details. Otherwise, leave the boxes blank.</li>
 	<li>Click <strong>Save customer</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Checkmark the <strong>Ship to a different address?</strong> box. This will open a new window.</li>
 	<li>Unless the PO or email message says otherwise, enter the name of the person who submitted the PO into the <strong>First</strong> and <strong>Last</strong> name boxes.</li>
 	<li>Update the rest of the shipping details.</li>
 	<li>If possible, always include a phone number, but if none is provided, leave the box blank.</li>
 	<li>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button.</li>
 	<li>Click the <strong>Save To Customer</strong> button below the address box. This will save the shipping address details to the customer's account so it can be used for future orders.</li>

Last Updated: December 7, 2025
<h3>Board Design Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The absolute maximum physical array size is <b>113.8 mm</b> x <b>148 mm</b>. Anything larger will not fit our equipment. (Updated on Dec 7. 2025)</li>
 	<li>For 500V hi-pot testing, the absolute minimum distance of any live pads or traces from the edge of the board is 0.8mm. If possible, keep live elements at least 1mm from the board edge.</li>
 	<li>The minimum distance between live traces must be 0.8mm. This is important for 500V HIPOT testing.</li>
 	<li>Try to keep at least 0.8mm between live and dead copper. You can go as close as 0.2mm if necessary, but this may cause problems with 500V hi-pot testing.</li>
 	<li>The absolute minimum distance between the board's edge and any copper is 0.35mm.</li>
 	<li>Solder pads should be designed with the solder mask 0.1mm from the edge of the copper.</li>
 	<li>Pads side by side should be spaced at least 0.6mm apart whenever possible.</li>
 	<li>Minimum trace width:
<ul>
 	<li>For Rebels: 0.2 mm - Max 1A drive current</li>
 	<li>For later LEDs: 0.6 mm - Max 2A current</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>The minimum array size is 70 mm x 70 mm in order to accommodate v-scoring from JLCPCB.</li>
 	<li>Traces should be laid out in 90 and 45-degree angles whenever possible.</li>
 	<li>Traces should connect to pads at 90 degrees if possible.</li>
 	<li>Trace bends should be radiused at 0.5mm. Using radii less than 0.5mm is not recommended.</li>
 	<li>All Rebel boards must have a clear space for printing the 2-digit LED code. This space has an absolute minimum size of 2.2 mm wide x 1.5 mm high.</li>
 	<li>Our preferred font is Tahoma Bold. Use the largest font possible.</li>
 	<li>The font used for the domain part number is TAHOMA Bold.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id=""Design_Checklist"" class=""mw-headline"">Design Checklist</span></h3>
Before submitting the Gerber files to the board manufacturer, use the following checklist to be sure nothing has been forgotten.
<h5><span id=""Drawing_Checks"" class=""mw-headline"">Drawing Checks</span></h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Is the array size less than the maximum array size? (See Design Guidelines above)</li>
 	<li>Is the product domain name on all bases?</li>
 	<li>Are all solder pads correctly identified on all bases in the array?</li>
 	<li>Are the traces correctly routed and repeated on all bases in the array?</li>
 	<li>Are the correct holes provided for compatible optics?</li>
 	<li>Have compatible lenses been checked for fit?</li>
 	<li>Have compatible lenses been checked to be sure suitable solder pads are accessible?</li>
 	<li>Have you confirmed that the LEDs are properly centered in all compatible optics? Be especially careful with LED modules compatible with the Carclo Hex holder.</li>
 	<li>Are any of the silkscreen markings covering any of the pads?</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id=""Gerber_File_Checks"" class=""mw-headline"">Gerber File Checks</span></h5>
<ul>
 	<li>When you exported the drawing to the Gerber/Drill file, did you select metric as the drawing unit?</li>
 	<li>Have you reviewed every layer using the Gerber viewer to confirm everything is correctly placed?</li>
 	<li>Did you include all of the layers needed for the base?</li>
 	<li>Did you include the drill file in the Gerber export?</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id=""Converting_Text_to_Primitives"" class=""mw-headline"">Converting Text to Primitives</span></h3>
Any CAD font you use must be converted to line primitives before it can be imported into DipTrace. Many fonts don't display very well in DipTrace, so it's always best to lay out the text in CAD and then convert the fonts you use to primitives. This method also allows you to rotate text at any angle, while DipTrace's text insert function only allows 90-degree angle rotation.
<div class=""thumb tright"">
<div class=""thumbinner"">
<div class=""thumbcaption"">
<div class=""magnify"">Note that due to the way fonts are handled in CAD, you first need to MIRROR the text vertically. If you don't mirror the text, the following process may not work.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol>
 	<li>In the drawing, type <b>WMFOUT</b>.</li>
 	<li>Select a location somewhere to save the file.</li>
 	<li>Select the text that you need to convert.</li>
 	<li>Press <b>Enter</b>.</li>
 	<li>Type <b>WMFIN</b> and select the WMF file that you just saved.</li>
 	<li>Select an open space somewhere in the drawing to insert the wmf drawing.</li>
 	<li>Press Enter for the x-scale factor, y-scale factor, and rotation angle</li>
 	<li>Select the converted text and mirror it back to its original orientation.</li>
 	<li>Rescale and reposition the converted text over the original text and delete the original font.</li>
 	<li>Use the solid hatch command to fill the text outlines.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span id=""Creating_and_Importing_Extremely_Small_Text_&amp;_Other_Elements_Into_DipTrace""></span><span id=""Creating_and_Importing_Extremely_Small_Text_.26_Other_Elements_Into_DipTrace"" class=""mw-headline"">Creating and Importing Extremely Small Text and Other Elements Into DipTrace</span></h3>
If you need to import tiny text, e.g., text as small as 0.15mm high, use the following procedure. This is necessary as DipTrace will not correctly import tiny filled objects.

Note that due to the way fonts are handled in CAD, you first need to MIRROR any fonts vertically. If you don't mirror the text, the following process may not work.
<ol>
 	<li>In the drawing, type <b>WMFOUT</b>.</li>
 	<li>Select a location somewhere to save the file.</li>
 	<li>Select the text and elements that you need to import into DipTrace.</li>
 	<li>Press <b>Enter</b>.</li>
 	<li>Type <b>WMFIN</b> and select the wmf file that you just saved.</li>
 	<li>Select an open space somewhere in the drawing to insert the wmf drawing.</li>
 	<li>Press Enter for the x-scale factor, y-scale factor, and rotation angle</li>
 	<li>Select the converted text and mirror it back to its original orientation.</li>
 	<li>Save just the objects you converted as an <b>AutoCad 2013 DXF</b> file.</li>
 	<li>Import that DXF file into DipTrace, converting them to <b>Top Pads</b> with <b>Fill closed areas</b> and <b>Embedded Polygons</b> checkmarked. This will correctly import the elements as filled objects.</li>
 	<li>Export the layer with the objects you just imported (usually the Top layer) as a <b>Gerber</b> file.</li>
 	<li>Import the Gerber file you just exported and convert the layer with the objects you need to <b>Top Mask</b>.</li>
 	<li>Now, you can go into the DipTrace drawing and change the object type to whatever you need. E.g., Mask, Silk Screen, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span id=""Importing_CAD_Files_Into_DipTrace"" class=""mw-headline"">Importing CAD Files Into DipTrace</span></h3>
PCB design is always completed in CAD, with the design imported into DipTrace. To import, use the following process.
<ol>
 	<li>Be sure that all spaces that need to be filled are drawn with snapped lines or closed polylines.</li>
 	<li>All Tahoma font text that is drawn in CAD must be converted to primitive lines using the Express &gt; Text &gt; <b>Explode Text</b> function in CAD.</li>
 	<li>Use the LISP <strong>DXF Prep</strong> command to remove all unnecessary elements from the drawing</li>
 	<li>Save the drawing as an <b>AutoCAD 2018 ASCII DXF</b> file.</li>
 	<li>In DipTrace, open an existing drawing to use it as a template. Delete the array and save the file in a new directory.</li>
 	<li>You must close the original CAD file (DXF) before you can import the DXF into DipTrace.</li>
 	<li>Click File &gt; Import &gt; DXF and select the CAD file.</li>
 	<li>Change the DXF Units to <b>millimeters</b></li>
 	<li>Change the Import Mode to <b>Add</b></li>
 	<li>Checkmark <b>Fill Closed areas</b> and <b>Embedded Polygons</b></li>
 	<li>Select each layer and choose which layer to convert it to in DipTrace.</li>
 	<li>Click <b>Import</b>.</li>
 	<li>Check to be sure everything is imported and filled correctly. If the fill is partial or missing, there are open lines in the CAD drawing.</li>

<div class=""thumb tright"">

&nbsp;

It is important to become familiar with a variety of filter types as customer quotes are based off website lead times. If a particular base or LED will not be available for some time it would be best to set up the Lead Time differently than those modules that are in stock. Say for example our supplier says that the LED LXML-PR02-A900 will not be available for two weeks but we have 200 LEDs on hand. Using a rough estimate of how many modules we make using this LED it might be best to say 3-5 Days until more stock can be made instead of the regular 1-3 Days for in stock modules.

To set up a filter to do this this is one example to do:
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Click on the <strong>Add Filter</strong> button near the top of the page then select <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'Modul</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> LED'</strong></span></em>. Change the second drop down menu to <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'Is'</strong></span> </em>and the last drop down set to <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'LXML-PR02-A900'.</strong></span></em> Click on the <strong>Blue Check Mark Box</strong> so that the completed filter reads as, <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'Module LED is LXML-PR02-A900'.</strong></span><strong> </strong></em>Then follow Steps 3 to 5 above. Remember to use <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">3-5 Day</span>s in the text box for this example.</p>
Another example would be if bases such as SP-01 won't be available until the Start of March. To set up a filter for that this is one example to do so:
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Click on the <strong>Add Filter</strong> button near the top of the page then select <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'</strong><strong>Base</strong><strong> Type'</strong></span></em>. Change the second drop down menu to <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'Is'</strong></span> </em>and the last drop down set to <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'SP-01'</strong></span></em><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">.</span></em> Click on the <strong>Blue Check Mark Box</strong> so that the completed filter reads as, <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>'Base Type is SP-01'</strong></span></em><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">.</span></em> Then follow Steps 3 to 5 above. <span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">R</span>emember to use <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Available Start of March</span> in the text box for this example. Also, make sure to update the Lead Time for all modules using this base once inventory has been received.</p>",,publish,,setting-lead-times-for-led-modules-in-woocommerce,"2024-05-02 11:15:31","2024-05-02 17:15:31",0,0,,0,18,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Note that overdue emails are always sent at 10 AM on business days only. If the notification comes due on a weekend, then the notice will be sent the following Monday at 10 AM.
<h4>First Overdue Notice (15 days past due)</h4>
The first overdue invoice email (<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#search/Your+Luxeon+Star+LEDs+Invoice/FMfcgzGwJmJxqTXqbwSqkxrsqmRgqxvX"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">example here</a>) is automatically sent to the customer when an invoice is 15 days past its due date.

The following routines generate these reminders:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://luxeonstar.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=245014&amp;action=edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Overdue: N30 Invoice - 1st Customer Email</a></li>

</ul>
<h4>Second Overdue Notice (30 days past due)</h4>
When an order invoice is 30 days past its due date, the <strong>Send 2nd Overdue Request Email</strong> button will be displayed on the order page in the admin. An email will also be sent to office@quadica.com with details about the overdue invoice and a note saying that it needs to be reviewed to determine if the second overdue notice email message should be sent to the customer.

The following routines generates this email:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://luxeonstar.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=251167&amp;action=edit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Overdue: N30 Order Payment 30 Days Past Due Admin Email</a></li>

</ul>
The second overdue notice email is NOT automatically sent. Instead the order needs to be reviewed and the <strong>Send 2nd Overdue Request Email</strong> button clicked if it is determined that a second overdue email should be sent to the customer.

When the <strong>Send 2nd Overdue Request Email</strong> button on the order page is clicked, an email (<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#search/Action+Required%3A+Luxeon+Star+LEDs+Invoice/FMfcgzGwJmHpxHfkXwkJNlSqggbgmVCN"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">example here</a>) is sent to the following email addresses associated with the order:
<ul>
 	<li>The email address in the <strong>Billing Address</strong> section of the order. This is usually the same as the customer's account email address, but it can be changed for each specific order.</li>
 	<li>The email address in the <strong>Email</strong> box in the <strong>Contact Info</strong> section of the customer's account page.</li>
 	<li>All of the invoicing email addresses in the <strong>Invoicing Email Address(s)</strong> box in the customer's account page.</li>
</ul>
Each email address will receive its own overdue email message. CC is not used. Only a single email will be sent to each unique email address. Duplicates will be ignored.
<h4>Final Overdue Notice (60 days past due)</h4>
If the order invoice is not paid at 60 days past due, then an email will be sent to office@quadica.com with the order details and the recommendation that the customer account be put on hold.

To put a customer account on hold, go to the customer's account in the admin and checkmark the<strong> Account On Hold</strong> box. This will do the following:
<ul>
 	<li>You will get a warning message saying that all customer accounts with the same company name will also be put on hold.</li>
 	<li>A text box option will open where the text of the email that is sent to the customer if they try to enter a new order is entered. This text must include the entire email message with details about why their account is on hold. The text entered into this box will typically look like this and include the following details:
<table style=""width: 87.6819%; border-collapse: collapse; background-color: #ceffcc; margin-top: 10px;"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 100%;"">Hello,

The Banctec Canada Inc. account is on hold due to non-payment of our invoice 139456 for your PO 4500111324 shipped on Jan 11, 2023.

Please reply to this email message to arrange payment of this past-due invoice so we can process your new order.

</li>
 	<li>Be sure to include the Salutation and Signature lines in the text, and remember to save the changes to the customer account.</li>
 	<li>An automated process will put all of the user accounts with the exact same company name in the Customer billing address on hold. The process will also copy the email message to the user accounts.</li>
</ul>
Putting the customer's account on hold <strong>WILL NOT</strong> send out any emails to the customer. This is because, at this point, several emails have already been sent out, and there is little point in sending any more.

Instead, if any person from the company tries to submit a new order, then the new order will be automatically put on hold, and an email message (<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#all/FMfcgzGwJmMRWlhlGkbJNjtVLQfKTgrN"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">example here</a>) sent to the customer about their account being on hold with a request to contact us to arrange payment so that their new order can be released and processed.

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Backlink Quantity is Irrelevant:</strong> A single high-quality link can be more impactful than millions of low-quality ones.</li>
 	<li><strong>Duplicate Content Isn’t Penalized:</strong> Google displays one version of the content and ignores the rest.</li>
 	<li><strong>Website Presentation Affects Rankings:</strong> Poor visual presentation can negatively influence a site’s perception and search visibility.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ranking Changes Can Take a Month:</strong> After quality improvements, it might take up to a month to see changes in search results.</li>
 	<li><strong>Core Web Vitals Are More Than Tiebreakers:</strong> They significantly influence rankings and user experience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Core Web Vitals Data Updates Every 28 Days:</strong> It takes time for improvements to affect ranking signals.</li>
 	<li><strong>Word Count Isn’t a Ranking Factor:</strong> The quality of content matters more than its length.</li>
 	<li><strong>Original Page Titles Are Used for Rankings:</strong> Even if Google modifies them in search results, the original titles influence rankings.</li>
 	<li><strong>Heading Tags Send Strong Signals:</strong> They help Google understand the topic of a page.</li>
 	<li><strong>Domain Name Keywords Don’t Impact Rankings:</strong> Keywords in a domain name are not a ranking signal.<a class=""anchor"" href=""https://forum.ecommercefuel.com/t/googles-seo-guidance-summarized/74006#main-content-1"" name=""main-content-1""></a></li>
 	<li><strong>Focus Keyword Visibility Is Crucial:</strong> It should appear in titles, headings, and throughout the content.</li>
 	<li><strong>Unique Content Should Be Above the Fold:</strong> Aim for some unique content in the immediately visible area of a webpage.</li>
 	<li><strong>Spelling and Grammar Matter:</strong> Errors can indicate low-quality content.</li>
 	<li><strong>New Content Usually Indexed Within a Week:</strong> Time to indexing can vary but is typically around a week.</li>
 	<li><strong>Different Formats Are Not Duplicate Content:</strong> Identical content in video and text formats is considered different by Google.</li>
 	<li><strong>Anchor Text Should Provide Context:</strong> It helps Google understand the linked content.</li>
 	<li><strong>Long Anchor Text Can Be Beneficial:</strong> More extended anchor texts provide more context.</li>
 	<li><strong>404 Errors Are Normal:</strong> They are not treated as negative ranking factors.</li>
 	<li><strong>No Technical Fix for Quality Issues:</strong> Improving website quality goes beyond technical solutions.</li>
 	<li>Keep URLs Same During Site Revamps: Changing URLs can lead to a loss in ranking.</li>
 	<li><strong>Multiple H1 Tags Are Acceptable:</strong> There’s no limit on using H1 tags on a page.<a class=""anchor"" href=""https://forum.ecommercefuel.com/t/googles-seo-guidance-summarized/74006#general-seo-2"" name=""general-seo-2""></a></li>
 	<li><strong>Mobile Versions Indexed by Default:</strong> Google primarily indexes mobile versions of web pages.</li>
 	<li><strong>Not All Pages Get Indexed:</strong> It’s normal for some pages not to be indexed.</li>

Docs,3094,10,"2024-05-07 13:40:53","2024-05-07 19:40:53","How To Use And Update The Quadica Production Layout App","<h2>How It Works</h2>
When the program starts it polls both the production.csv file as specified in the Control Panel, as well as the Module Base Data sheet. It aquires all production csv data as well as settings data and position data for the codes / base types. The production data is stored and a copy is made. This allows the user to filter the data in various ways and then restore it if they need to. The user selects a base type, which automatically populates a layout pattern with the data. The user is then able to filter or alter the data using the X'ing feature, or by shifting the data with the arrow buttons. The user can also click directly on the codes to modify them as needed. Once they have the data laid out the way they need, they can hit ""Save Image"" and generate the printable file. The file will be named incrementally based on existing files in the output directory. Files are named seqentially based on the batch and their base type.

<hr />

<h2 id=""firstHeading"" class=""firstHeading"" lang=""en""><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">General Usage</span></h2>
<div id=""bodyContent"" class=""mw-body-content"">
<div id=""mw-content-text"" class=""mw-content-ltr"" dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">
<div class=""mw-parser-output"">

The app will automatically import data from the production list CSV file that is generated via the OM. You will still need to generate and save this file.

The welcome screen will populate with buttons linking to the different layouts depending on what is found in the batch. Each <i>layout</i> will feature a number of <i>frets</i> and will corrispond to an <i>insert</i> to be loaded into the printer for the base type you are working with. The frets host varying numbers of <i>modules</i>, which themselves will have <i>codes</i> laid out onto them.

The <b>Base Type</b> dropdown in the bottom left corner can also be used to navigate to different layouts.

You can use the <b>Order</b> dropdown to filter the data by order number, having the welcome screen contain only buttons for layouts pertinent to the selected order number. You can also sort by stock, which will similarly only display layouts for which stock products exist in the batch.

Layouts themselves will also filter data by order if one is selected. If a given batch contains a total of 200 SP-01 modules, and order number 123456 contains 50 SP-01, filtering by this order number will have the layout for SP-01 display only the 50 modules for this particular order number, where setting it to ""All"" will have the layout draw all 200 modules.

When working with a layout, the center point for each module is indicated by a grey circle. Clicking anywhere inside this circle will toggle the module as <i>X'd</i>. X'd modules will be skipped when the data is being laid out. You can toggle the X's off again by clicking on them. You can also toggle the state of all modules using the ""Toggle All X's"" checkbox at the bottom, or toggle frets induviduals using the checkboxes at the top.

Each code that is laid out on the modules can be changed by clicking directly on the code itself. Doing so will allow the code to be modified, and hitting ""Enter"" will save the change. You can use ""Escape"" to cancel the changes and revert the code to it's original value.

Clicking <b>Save Image</b> once you have modified the layout to reflect the boards you intend to print will automatically name and save the printable .png image to <i>\Shared drives\Quadica\Production\Layout App Print Files</i>. File names will contain the batch id, base type, and a number which will be automatically incremented. You should delete the images from this directory once you have printed them on the bases.

Anything saved to an image will be removed from the list of items remaining to be processed, and once all modules have been procssed the layout will become inaccessible until the program is reset.

The <b>Reset</b> button in the bottom right will revert all filtering and modifications. No changes to the product data will be saved.

Any changes to the sheet may take up to ten minutes to properly take affect.

This guide assumes a new insert has been drawn in Corel (G:\Shared drives\Quadica\Employee Files\Russ\Current Projects\Full Fixtures\Cut _ Print ready full fixtures). You will need to get from this file the measurments for the various datapoints that we need to populate the sheet with information about the insert, frets, and modules. To add a new design to the program you must ensure that all requisite data is included in the sheet. Position values are measured in inches.

The values in the sheet correspond to position and rotation information for each base type:

<h2>Dependancies and Re-compiling</h2>
The program is written in Python and includes the following libraries that may need to be installed via PIP:
<ul>
 	<li>ghostscript - may require manual install</li>
 	<li>tkinter</li>
 	<li>PIL</li>
 	<li>csv</li>
 	<li>pandas</li>
 	<li>requests</li>
 	<li>io</li>
 	<li>webbrowser</li>
 	<li>os</li>
 	<li>math</li>
</ul>
The program is compilled using pyinstaller. To do so, open a command prompt, cd to the directory where the ""qpla_v0.0.py"" file exists, and run ""pyinstaller qpla_v0.0.py -F"". This will create all the necessary build files and folders automatically in that directory. Currently the program is stored in ""Q:\Shared drives\Quadica\Custom Software\Quadica Production Layout App\New Build"". The directory will contain ""qpla_v0.0.spec"" and three folders: ""build"", ""dist"", and ""Version History"". The first two are generated by the installer. Version History contains older versions of the program. If you need to rebuild the program, delete the spec file as well as the build, and dist folders. They will be re-generated when the command to recompile is given.

<h4>Power Supply To Computer Connection</h4>
We use a USB connection from the PS to the computer. The USB is actually a COM port connection. Not USB. Configuring the connection as true USB was not successful, but using the COM port works fine.
<h4>Power Supply Configuration</h4>
The power supply must be configured on the unit as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Interface: USB</li>
 	<li>Settings: CDC (Serial port type)</li>
 	<li>Interface: HO732</li>
</ul>

If the USB connection is working correctly, you should see a new USB Serial Device show up in the control panel. Note the port number.
<h4>RsInstrument Setup</h4>
RsInstrument is an add-on created by Rohde &amp; Schwarz that is run inside of PYCharm. You should see the HMP2030 in the instrument list.
<ol>
 	<li>Click the settings pencil, select the Serial port option on the left, and then Search for Serial Instruments.</li>
 	<li>Set the Com port to match the serial port in the control panel setup.</li>
 	<li>Run a test, and you should connect to the power supply</li>
</ol>
You will need the connection string to run the main.py code of our test script. To get the connection string, click on the Copy Constructor Code option and then paste that string into the <strong>Initialize the session</strong> section of the main.py code of our test script. You should then be able to connect to the power supply.
<h4>Things To Check If The Setup Is Not Working</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Be sure the latest version of the Vesa driver is installed and configured. (RS_VISA_Setup_Win_7_2_3.exe)</li>
 	<li>Be sure the latest version of the HO732 USB driver is installed into Windows. (HO732-USB-Driver-1_0.zip)</li>

These files are maintained in the Q:\Custom Software\Quadica Production Layout App\Text Position Data folder.

Every LED module in production needs two files for the UV laser. A CSV file that contains the exact location where the text is engraved onto the base. A DXF file is used to help orient the location of the engraved text in the UV laser engraving app.

The files must be named using the base SKU with the current revision letter, E.g., sz-04b.csv and sz-04b.dxf for the SZ-04 revision ""b"" module.

These files are created and generated in the CAD file for each module. You can use the sw-01a.dwg CAD file as a reference when creating a new set of production CAD files for a new module. Here are the key steps you must follow when creating the engraving drawing in the LED module CAD file.
<ol>
 	<li>Copy the array outline and the outlines of the LEDs.</li>
 	<li>Draw a border around the array to the <strong>Q-Array Info</strong> layer.</li>

<ol>
 	<li><strong>By Product</strong> - Sets the number of modules to be inspected whenever this specific product is in a production batch. This sampling rate is usually set at a higher rate for high-value products.</li>
 	<li><strong>By Order</strong> - Sets the number of modules to be inspected in a specific order. This applies to all modules in the order. E.g., if the order contains 100 modules of three different types, and the sampling rate is set to 5%, then five randomly selected modules would be inspected. An effort should be made to include modules from each product type during the inspection.</li>
 	<li><strong>By Customer</strong> - Sets the number of modules to be inspected for all orders from a specific customer. This is determined by the customer's email address. E.g. all orders from bill@somewhere.com will use this sampling rate.</li>
 	<li><strong>By Organization</strong> - Sets the number of modules to be inspected for all orders from a specific organization. This is determined by the domain name used in the order. E,g., all orders from stingray.com will use this sampling rate.</li>
</ol>
When a production batch report is generated, the OM system will use the sampling rate with the highest % setting. E.g., if the customer has a sampling rate of 15%, and all other sampling rates are lower, then 15% will be used for all of the modules from that customer.

Sampling rates for Products, Orders, and Customers are set on the admin screens. Organization sampling rates are set using the <a href=""https://luxeonstar.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=company_qc"">Sampling Rates section</a> in the admin.

Sampling rate settings are only applied to LED modules in production batches. They are not used for other products.

Docs,3271,10,"2024-11-30 12:56:05","2024-11-30 19:56:05","X-Ray Inspection Procedure","All LED modules produced by Quadica are x-ray inspected using a randomized selection method with preset sampling rates that are preset based on the product, order, customer, and organization. More details about how these rates are set <a href=""https://quadica.info/kb/x-ray-inspection-sampling-rates/"">can be found here</a>.
<h3>Sampling Rates</h3>
The sampling rate is determined when the <strong>Batch Report</strong> for a production batch is generated. The rate will be shown in the <strong>QC Qty</strong> column of the report and will be the <strong>minimum number of modules</strong> that must be inspected. Note that this value is the number of modules that should be inspected. NOT the percentage. Additional LED modules may be inspected if needed.
<h3>Enabling The X-Ray Machine</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Turn the red rocker switch on the x-ray machine so it is lighted.</li>
 	<li>Place the tray to be x-rayed into the machine.</li>
 	<li>Be sure the door is closed and latched.</li>
 	<li>Start the GTI-5000 app on the computer.</li>
 	<li>Start the MC110 app on the computer.</li>
 	<li>Ensure that the Interlock light on the MC110 software is green.</li>
 	<li>Ensure that the Voltage is set to <strong>80</strong> and the Power is set to <strong>8.0</strong>.</li>
 	<li>It may take a moment for the x-ray tube to warm up. During that time, you will not be able to turn it on.</li>
 	<li>Click the <strong>On</strong> button in the MC110 app to turn on the x-ray. If it will not turn on, Click the Off button and then click the On button again.</li>
 	<li>Minimize the MC110 app so you can see the GTI-5000 app.</li>
 	<li>Click on <strong>Aquire</strong> &gt; <strong>Live</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Select the 32 Frames option from the left-hand menu with the blue frame rate options. 32 frames will allow you to move the tray around and have the image resolve reasonably quickly.</li>
 	<li>Select 128 or 256 from the frame rate list for a clearer image.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Inspection Process</h3>
All inspections should be video recorded.
<ol>
 	<li>Modules can be inspected before or after light testing.</li>
 	<li>Modules are typically inspected in the transport trays.</li>
 	<li>Separate the trays by production batch for inspection.</li>
 	<li>Click on <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Video Recorder</strong>. This will open the <strong>Video Recorder</strong> window.</li>
 	<li>Click the button with the round red spot to start recording. Everything on the screen will now be recorded.</li>
 	<li>Randomly select and inspect the minimum sampling rate shown in the <strong>QC Qty</strong> column of the batch report for each LED module.</li>
 	<li>Randomized selections should focus on the corners and edges of the arrays. Separate modules should also be prioritized during random selection.</li>
 	<li>The main focus of the inspection is to confirm the void rate of the thermal pad(s).</li>
 	<li>The maximum acceptable void rate is <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>25%</strong></span>.</li>
 	<li>When you are done inspecting a batch of trays, click the square red button. You will be asked to save the file. Create a name using the batch ID followed by a unique number for each video (E.g., <strong>5669-1.avi) </strong>and save it to the G:\Shared drives\Quadica\Luxeon\<strong>X-Rays</strong> folder.</li>
 	<li>Note that after saving a video, you must enable the <strong>Live</strong> view again by clicking on <strong>Aquire</strong> &gt; <strong>Live</strong> to continue inspecting additional batches.</li>
 	<li>Do not try to calculate void rates using the x-ray software's built-in calculator. (It is not very accurate) Instead, refer to the sample void rate images on the computer and use your best judgment to determine if the void rate is near or over 25%.</li>
 	<li>If a module in a production batch appears to have a void rate greater than 25%, take an image of the module, then add a <strong>hold</strong> note to all of the trays from that batch until it can be determined if there is a problem with the batch. Let Ron know so a manual void rate calculation can be completed.</li>
 	<li>If there are no issues with excessive voiding or other solder joint issues, then the batch can be received into inventory.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Saving X-Ray Images (Screenshot)</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Press the <strong>ALT-P</strong></li>
 	<li>The entire screen will be automatically saved to the Q:\Luxeon\<strong>X-Rays </strong>folder</li>

Docs,4032,10,"2025-02-01 10:56:03","2025-02-01 17:56:03","Datasheet PDF Templates","The Product PDF datasheet for each product SKU is created using an HTML product datasheet page. This page is generated using a WordPress ""parent"" template combined with a ""child"" template. The generated HTML page can then be printed as fully formatted PDF documents directly from the browser or using the browser headless print function built into Chrome.
<h3>Parent Template</h3>
The parent template is a WordPress page named <strong>single-product-specifications.php</strong> located in the <strong>/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/woocommerce</strong> directory. This template creates an HTML product specification page that does not include a header, footer or sidebar content. It only displays the content needed to print a PDF document. Additional details about how this template works are included in the PHP file.

The parent template includes functions that look up the <strong>base-id</strong> attribute for the current product being processed. This value is used to select a child template based on the slug name of the child template. E.g., If the <strong>base-id</strong> attribute for the <strong>SW-01-W5</strong> product is <strong>SW-01</strong>, then the script will select the child template with the <strong>SW-01</strong> slug name.

The parent template is registered with WordPress using the <strong>Single Product Specifications PHP Page Registration</strong> Code Snippets script. This is necessary to allow the page to be called and displayed using the https://luxeonstar.com/product/sw-01-w5/specifications/ link. The link includes the product SKU so that the correct child template is selected. This link can be used anywhere but is primarily used to generate a PDF file using the Chrome headless PDF generation command line.

The parent template script uses the selected child template to generate a datasheet webpage for the current product SKU. The script also processes all of the shortcodes embedded into the child template so the correct values are displayed on the datasheet webpage for the SKU.
<h3>Child Template</h3>
Child templates are maintained in an ACF-generated custom post type named <strong>PDF Template</strong>. There should be a matching child template for every series of products. E.g.,
<ul>
 	<li>SW-01 for the COFAN Star LED modules</li>
 	<li>SW-03 for the COFAN Tri-Star LED modules</li>
 	<li>SP-01 for the SinkPad Star LED modules</li>
 	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
Child templates are created and maintained as standard pages using WordPress Gutenberg with the GeneratePress/GenerateBlocks plugin. Each page should be named with the same name as the template slug. E.g., SW-01.

The easiest way to create a new child template is to use the <strong>Clone</strong> option shown on the template list page for the template you want to copy. This will ensure that all of the correct settings for the template are used.

Other than the first page, every page needed for the PDF file must be contained in a container (div) with a class name of <strong>pdf-page</strong>. This class name is set in the editor under the Advanced section for the container block in the <strong>Additional CSS class</strong> field.

As the template page is only rendered using the Chrome browser, any block or CSS feature can be used to create the child template.

CSS stylings for the generated template page are maintained in the PDF Datasheet Styling section of the /wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/style.css file.
<h3>PDF File Generation</h3>
The printable PDF document is generated using the following link that can be embedded anywhere on the website.
<ul>
 	<li>https://luxeonstar.com/product/<strong>sw-01-w5</strong>/specifications/</li>
</ul>
The link must contain the the product SKU for the document to be generated.

Due to security settings in the browsers, it is not possible to have this link generate and then automatically download a PDF file. You have to generate the page and then print the page. As this is not the best option for customers, we need to pre-create the PDF documents so that they can be downloaded from a link on the page.

To do this, an automated process will be created that will use the Chrome headless PDF generation command line to generate files for each product SKU. Note that this can only be done on a local PC. Here is a sample command line that can be used as part of the automation process:
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""color: #333399;"">""C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"" --headless --disable-gpu --no-pdf-header-footer --print-to-pdf=""C:\Users\ron\OneDrive\Documents\SW-01-W5 Datasheet.pdf"" --print-to-paper-size-letter ""https://luxeonstar.com/product/sw-01-w5/specifications/""</span></p>

The page scripts use this SVG file to determine the location of the LEDs on the module for drag-and-drop and hover functions.

All of the following steps must be followed exactly for the SVG file to work correctly.
<h3>Part 1 - CAD to Illustrator</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Open the LED module CAD drawing.</li>
 	<li>Remove all of the drawing elements except for the module outline, LED locations, through holes, and any other elements that should be included in the module drawing on the LED Builder page. The selected elements should be a very simple representation of the module.</li>
 	<li>The LED locations should be represented with a circle. The size does not matter. The circles are only used to position the drop zone elements in Illustrator.</li>
 	<li>Move all of the drawing elements to layer 0.</li>
 	<li>Change the color of all elements to white.</li>
 	<li>Set the line weight to 0.13.</li>
 	<li>Set the line type to <strong>Continuous</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Zoom to extents to be sure that only these elements are in the drawing.</li>
 	<li>Export the drawing as a <strong>2018 DXF file</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Open Illustrator.</li>
 	<li>Be sure that <strong>Units</strong> in Preferences are currently set to <strong>Pixels</strong> for <strong>General</strong> and <strong>Stroke</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Use File &gt; Open to open the DXF file you just created.</li>
 	<li>In the DXF options box, select <strong>Scale by 100%</strong>, Select <strong>Millimeters</strong> as the import unit, and set the Unit(s) value to <strong>6.5</strong>. This scaling factor is necessary to get the DXF file imported at the right size for the canvas.</li>
 	<li>Set the Artboard so it is 400 x 400 px square. Windows &gt; Artboards &gt; Click the page icon &gt; Change the width &amp; height values to 400 px. The image should be centered in the artboard.</li>
 	<li>Select the entire image &gt; Select Properties &gt; set the stroke width to 1 px.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2 - Add Drop Zone &amp; Hover Elements</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Open the Q:\Luxeon\Graphics\Site Graphics\LED Module Builder\<strong>LED Module Builder.ai</strong> Illustrator template file. This file contains the elements needed for the SVG drop zone and hover images. The file has elements for 3 LEDs that will be used as templates in the new drawing.</li>
 	<li>Open the Layers window.</li>
 	<li>Click on the circle next to HOVER-ELEMENTS to select all of the elements in that layer.</li>
 	<li>Press CTRL-C &gt; go to your new SVG drawing &gt; press CTRL-V to copy and paste the HOVER-ELEMENTS to the new drawing.</li>
 	<li>Repeat this for the DRAG-DROP-ELEMENTS.</li>
 	<li>Using the elements just added, position them for each LED in the drawing, removing any elements that are not needed.</li>
 	<li>If you need to add additional elements for LEDs, then copy the element.</li>
 	<li>Once the elements you need have been created, go to the Layers window and rename those elements to match the LED number. E.g.,
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
 	<li>LED-4-DROP-ZONE</li>
 	<li>LED-4-DROP-ICON</li>
 	<li>LED-4-DROP-TEXT</li>
 	<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>This same naming convention must be applied to all elements, as it is how the drag-and-drop and hover code on the LED Builder page controls the display of each element on the page.</li>
 	<li>Once you have completed configuring the Illustrator file, save it to the Q:\Luxeon\Graphics\Site Graphics\LED Module Builder\ folder using the module ID for the file name. The file name should be all lowercase with dashes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3 - Create the SVG File &amp; Upload</h3>

</strong></span><span style=""color: #993300;""><em>Changes made to the OM code or custom plugins on the Luxeon Star LEDs server <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be synced back to this repository. Changes are only synced from the repository (the ""source of truth"") to the Luxeon Star LEDs Live server.</em></span></blockquote>
<h4>Making Minor Code Adjustments</h4>
If you need to make minor changes to OM or custom plugin code, you can do so by editing the files directly in the <a href=""https://github.com/Quadica/gitlux"">Quadica/gitlux repository</a> or with a linked code editor. Once you are finished, you can commit the changes directly to the Quadica/gitlux repository, and they will be immediately synced to the live Luxeon Star LEDs server.
<h4>Major Coding</h4>
Major code changes or additions should only be done on forked code in a cloned test environment. Currently, there are two forked/cloned environments.
<h5>rlux - Typically Used By Ron</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Github Repository - <a href=""https://github.com/warrisr/gitlux"">warrisr/gitlux</a></li>
 	<li>Testing Server - <a href=""http://env-luxeonstarleds-rlux.kinsta.cloud/wp-admin/"">http://env-luxeonstarleds-rlux.kinsta.cloud/wp-admin/</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>clux - Typically Used By Chris</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Github Repository - Quipster99/gitlux</li>
 	<li>Testing Server - <a href=""http://env-luxeonstarleds-clux.kinsta.cloud/wp-admin/"">http://env-luxeonstarleds-clux.kinsta.cloud/wp-admin/</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Changes made to files in the rlux and clux repos will be automatically synced to their respective testing servers.

If a Pull Request is initiated from these environments, the pull will originate from the <strong>Quadica/gitlux</strong> repo.

Notice when you generate a Pull Request that your environment will automatically change from warris/Quipster99 to Quadica. After processing the pull request, the files will be automatically synced to the Luxeon Star LEDs live server.
<h5>Syncing Changes from the Live Repo To The Test Repos</h5>
If the files in the Quadica/gitlux repository are updated, then you will see the following message in the test repos ""<strong>This branch is x commits behind</strong>"". It is safe to go ahead and sync the changes from the Quadica/gitlux repository to the test forks using the <strong>Sync Fork</strong> button. If there is a code conflict (the both the live and test repos have made changes to the same file), then you will get a warning that you have to resolve these conflicts.
<h5>Adding New Testing Sites</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>Create a new Kinsta testing server environment from the Luxeonstar Live site.</li>
 	<li>Create a new git repository for the testing site. This must be created under your own git account. NOT the Quadica account!</li>
 	<li>Fork a copy of the existing Live files from the Quadica/gitlux repo to your git repo.</li>
 	<li>Follow <a href=""https://kinsta.com/docs/wordpress-hosting/site-management/wordpress-github-cicd/?_gl=1*sgpdj1*_ga*OTI2OTAwODQ0LjE3MzQ3MzIwNzk.*_ga_R8LLNPRZTN*czE3NDk4MzY2OTUkbzE3MSRnMSR0MTc0OTg3MjYxOCRqNjAkbDAkaDA."">these instructions <em>exactly</em></a> to configure the git repository to sync changes from the repo to the testing server automatically</li>
